# Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard
Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI and Postgresql

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a dynamic and interactive dashboard for analyzing credit card usage and transaction data. The dashboard provides insights into transaction trends, customer demographics, spending behaviors, and key performance metrics using data visualization techniques.

## Week-over-Week (WoW) Changes
 - **Revenue:** Increased by 28.8%.
 - **Total Transaction Amount & Count:**  Increased by 33.5%  & 9.09%.
 

## Year-to-Date (YTD) Overview
 - **Overall Revenue:** $57 million.
 - **Total Interest:** $8 million.
 - **Total Transaction Amount:** $46 million.
 - **Gender Contribution to Revenue:** Male customers contributed $31 million, female customers contributed $26 million.
 - **Credit Card Contribution:** Blue & Silver credit cards contributed to 93% of overall transactions.
 - **Top Contributing States:** TX, NY & CA contributed to 68% of total transactions.
 - **Overall Activation Rate:** 57.5%.
   
## Key Features
 - **Data Integration:** Integrates multiple data sources (e.g., transaction data) using SQL for data extraction and transformation.
 - **Visualization:** Utilizes Power BI for creating interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards that depict credit card usage patterns and trends.
 - **Dashboard Components:**
      - **Transaction Trends:** Visualizes transaction volume over time, average transaction amounts, and popular spending categories.
      - **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzes customer demographics and spending behaviors to identify key customer segments.
      - **Performance Metrics:** Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as card activation rates, utilization rates, and customer acquisition trends.

## Technologies Used

 - **SQL:** Used for data extraction, transformation, and integration from multiple data sources.
 - **Power BI:** Employed for data visualization, creating insightful charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards.
 - **Excel:** Initial data cleaning and preprocessing.


## Usage
 ### 1. Data Preparation:
     - Use SQL queries to extract and transform credit card transaction data.
     - Clean and preprocess data using Excel or Python Pandas.

 ### 2. Dashboard Creation:

    - Open Power BI and load the cleaned dataset.
    - Create visualizations (charts, graphs, dashboards) based on project requirements.

 ### 3. Interact with Dashboard:

   - Explore transaction trends, customer segments, and performance metrics.
   - Use filters and drill-down options for detailed analysis.
